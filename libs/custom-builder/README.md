# CustomBuilder

Custom Builder makes it possible to work with custom elements without using CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA - no need for turning template check off.

## For Contributors

Run `npm run watch` to watch and build changes made on the `custom-builder`.

Run `npm run link` to link the built version to @angularboost/custom-builder.

Run `npm run start` to serve `apps/angularboost` and test `custom-builder`.

If you want to test different builders within custom-builder (e.g. browser, application, etc.) you can change the build config under `apps/angularboost/project.json`
